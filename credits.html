                    <p>Indigenous stories have been told and shared through many generations. 
                        Often received in dreams and moments of clarity.
                        Our forefathers were inspired by these dreams and with sacrifice and 
                        courage, forged a new life in a land undiscovered.
                        As generations past, many stopped hearing, stopped dreaming, stopped 
                        believing, stopped understanding.
                        Our ancestors have emerged once again, to reconnect with those who 
                        will hear and share their messages of courage,
                        strength and inspiration.

                        embraces new indigenous stories depicting connection, remembrance, 
                        courage, strength, inspiration, community and family.
